The real-world-data group is about the use of Clojure for data and science problems.

## Goal
We wish to create a space for individuals, companies, academic groups, and organizations to  share their experiences and support each other in using Clojure for data & science projects. Data analytics, machine learning, AI, data engineering, scientific computing, and data visualization are all welcome.

It should be a safe space, that would be comfortable for sharing successes, troubles, problems, hopes, and doubts. We want it to be useful not only for those who use mostly Clojure but also for those who are curious-but-doubtful.

## Format
As a group, we will meet biweekly. In our sessions, we will discuss our ongoing projects. Participants will bring their own data & science to the sessions and actively work on them between sessions.

Some of the time will be dedicated to to learning relevant practices, ideas, and technical topics.

We will also have one-on-one or small-group sessions to support individial journeys.

## Recording
The sessions will be partially recorded.

Most of recordings will not be shared publicly, but rather used internally for ourselves to catch up and recall our own discussions. When recordings are planned to be made public, we will first check witll all participants.

## Participating
This group is for you if you wish to use Clojure for a data or science project, and prefer not to be alone in that journey.

We assume that you are planning to attend most of the biweekly sessions and to work on your project in between them. We will also assume that you do know some Clojure or have a serious intention to learn it.

To join, please reach out to us, and we will think together about whether this group fits your path.
