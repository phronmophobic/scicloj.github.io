The real-world-data group is about the use of Clojure for data and science problems.

## Goal
This group will be a space for individuals, companies, academic groups, and organizations to share their experiences and support each other in using Clojure for data & science projects. Data analytics, machine learning, AI, data engineering, scientific computing, and data visualization are all welcome.

It should be a safe space that would be comfortable for sharing successes, troubles, problems, hopes, and doubts. We want it to be useful for those who use mostly Clojure and for those who are curious but doubtful.

## Sessions
As a group, we will have biweekly sessions to discuss our ongoing projects. Participants will bring their own data & science to the sessions and actively work on them between sessions.

Some of the time will be dedicated to learning relevant practices, ideas, and technical topics.

We will also have one-on-one or small-group sessions to support individual journeys.

### Recordings
The sessions will be partially recorded.

Most of the recordings will not be shared publicly but rather internally as a tool for us to catch up and recall our past discussions. When recordings are planned to be made public, we will first check with all participants.

## Participating
If you wish to use Clojure for a data or science project and prefer not to be alone in that journey, this group is possibly for you.

We assume that you plan to attend most of the biweekly sessions and work on your project between them. We will also assume that you either know some Clojure or have a serious intention to learn it.

To join, please reach out to us, and we will think together about whether this group fits your path.
