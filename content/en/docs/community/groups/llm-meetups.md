The goal of this series of meetups is to support our learning, as a community, of the new landscape of ideas around large language models.

We are also considering organizing a more systematic study group that will meet regularly around these topics. For now, this is just a series of mostly self-contained public meetups.
 
Some of the content here is specific to the Clojure ecosystem (e.g., discussing the use of LLMs from Clojure), but many parts of it could be helpful and interesting to broader audiences.

## Meetings
* 2023-05-26, Intro to LLMs - by Martynas Maciulevičius - [event](https://clojureverse.org/t/scicloj-llm-meetup-1-introduction-login-for-details/): an overview of the topic, introducing a few of the basic ideas behind LLMs and demonstrating some of the practices of prompt engineering.
* TBA (soon), LLMOps with [Bosquet](https://github.com/zmedelis/bosquet) - by Žygimantas Medelis (assuming some familiarity with LLMs)
* TBA, transformer-based models - architecture, ideas and practices - by Dimid Duchovny

## Recordings
Most meetings will be recorded and shared publicly. 

## Recommended resources

### Clojure activity around LLMs
* At the [#clojurellm](https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/C054XC5JVDZ) channel in the Clojurians Slack, a group of Clojurians is working on helping LLMs to understand Clojure.
* [Ryan Robitaille](https://twitter.com/ryrobes) has been sharing experiments connecting LLMs to dataflow UIs (Rabbit Remix).
* Matthew Downey has created [rendergpt](https://github.com/matthewdowney/rendergpt), a Chrome extension for rendering structured output from ChatGPT interactively.
